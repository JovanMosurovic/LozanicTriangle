# Lozanic Triangle
This C++ project simulates search operations within a specialized triangle, referred to as the Lozanic Triangle. Users can execute binary and ternary search algorithms within the triangle, and the program provides a detailed output of each step of the search process. Additionally, it measures the time complexity of each algorithm by displaying the duration taken for execution.

> My primary goal of this project was to get familiar with binary and ternary search and their efficiency as well as performance with smaller and larger amounts of data. I also got acquainted with a model of a triangle by the famous chemist and academician from Belgrade, Sima Lozanić
> 
> This project was developed as the [first university assignment](instructions.pdf) for "Algorithms and Data Structures 2", University of Belgrade School of Electrical Engineering majoring Software Engineering. Please refer to the file for detailed assignment instructions.

## Features

- **Lozanic Triangle Generation**: Creates a modified version of Pascal’s Triangle. You can find more info about triangle in [instructions](instructions.pdf).
- **Binary and Ternary Search Simulations**: Conducts binary and ternary searches on the Lozanic Triangle.
- **Performance Metrics**: Outputs the number of accesses and time taken for each search operation.
- **User Interactive Menu**: A menu-driven interface that allows users to interact and choose options for running simulations.

## Code Structure

- **LozanicTriangle Class**: Handles the creation, manipulation, and deletion of the Lozanic Triangle.
- **Search Functions**: Includes binary and ternary search functions.
- **Menu and UI Functions**: Handles the user interface, displaying menus, results, and other messages.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To compile and run the Lozanic Triangle simulation, you need a C++ compiler (e.g. GCC) installed on your system.

### How to Run

1. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
2. Clone this repository.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the code.
4. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., GCC)
5. Run the executable.
6. Follow the on-screen instructions to execute the simulations.

## Note
Ensure that your terminal supports ASCII escape codes to view the colorized and formatted output correctly.
